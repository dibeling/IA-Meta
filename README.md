# Meta Analysis on Ideal Affect

Cultural differences in the emotions we ideally want to feel has been shown in several studies. For example, we have shown that European Americans prefer to feel high arousal positive emotions like excited more than their East Asian counterpart. Simimlarly, East Asians prefer to feel low arousal positive emotions like calmness more than their European American counterpart.

We are collecting more than a decade worth of data from unpublished and published papers on cultural differences in ideal affect. The purpose of this repository is to produce reproducible data through open sourcing code.
